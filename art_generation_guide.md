### Start Screen / Title Screen

**ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Optimized (Recommended):**

**Heroic Version:**
```
Create a dramatic video game title screen illustration in comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading. In the foreground, feature a heroic red cartoon crab gunslinger named Gisela - she's wearing a brown cowboy hat, red bandana around her neck, and holding two revolvers in a confident pose. She has natural crab features (claws, shell texture) but anthropomorphic. Behind her in the background, show a weathered wooden beach saloon with sandy elements and driftwood, with "Gisela's Last Stand" written on a sign above the swinging doors. Dark shadowy silhouettes of enemy sea creatures are attacking the saloon - lobster bandits, shrimp gunslingers, and hermit crab tanks emerging from darkness. Use dramatic sunset lighting with orange and purple sky tones creating long shadows. The composition should be cinematic with space at the top for a game logo. Wild west meets ocean beach aesthetic, bold saturated colors, stylized but detailed.
```

**Action Version:**
```
Create an action-packed video game title screen in comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading. Center frame shows a dynamic red cartoon crab gunslinger Gisela in motion - brown cowboy hat, red bandana, dual revolvers firing with bright muzzle flashes. She has natural crab features but stands upright like a cowboy. Behind her, a weathered beach saloon building is under siege, with "Gisela's Last Stand" carved above the doors. Warm golden light spills from the saloon windows. Dark enemy silhouettes surround the scene - menacing shapes of lobsters, shrimp, hermit crabs, and flying fish approaching from all sides creating a sense of danger. Dramatic sunset sky with orange and red tones. The composition is cinematic with room for title logo placement. Wild west beach theme, bold colors, game illustration style similar to Enter the Gungeon or Stardew Valley promotional art.

## Generation Tips

### ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Specific Tips

**For Sprite Generation:**
1. Start prompts with "Create a video game sprite" or "Create a game character asset"
2. Be explicit about the view angle: "isometric 3/4 top-down view at 45-degree angle"
3. Reference similar games for context: "similar to RimWorld, Stardew Valley, or Enter the Gungeon sprites"
4. Specify "transparent background" or "on white background for easy removal"
5. Request "square composition" or "centered in frame" for easier cropping
6. Mention "single character sprite" to avoid multiple variations in one image

**For Scene/Illustration Generation:**
1. Start with "Create a [style] illustration" or "Create a [style] scene"
2. Describe composition: "foreground, midground, background" explicitly
3. Specify lighting: "dramatic sunset lighting", "warm saloon lighting", etc.
4. Mention color palette: "bold saturated colors", "warm orange and purple tones"
5. Add style references: "comic book art style similar to [game/artist]"
6. Request specific aspect ratios if needed: "wide cinematic composition", "portrait orientation"

**Iterating with ChatGPT:**
- If results don't match: Ask ChatGPT to "adjust the previous image by..." rather than starting fresh
- Use "make it more [adjective]" for fine-tuning: "make it more cartoonish", "make it darker"
- Reference previous generations: "using the same style as the previous crab character"
- Request variations: "create 3 similar versions with slight pose differences"

**Common Issues & Fixes:**
- **Too realistic?** Add "stylized cartoon art", "simplified shapes", "comic book style"
- **Wrong angle?** Emphasize "viewed from 45-degree angle above", "slight overhead perspective"
- **Busy background?** Request "simple background", "minimal background", or "transparent background"
- **Inconsistent style?** Always include full style description: "comic book art with thick black outlines and cel-shading"

---

### Consistency Rules
1. **Always include:** "comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading"
2. **Always include:** "wild west beach theme" or "wild west saloon aesthetic"
3. **Always include:** "transparent background" for sprites
4. **Always include:** "isometric 3/4 top-down view" for characters/objects
5. **Reference games:** Mention "RimWorld or Stardew Valley character sprite" for consistency

### If Results Drift
- Regenerate with the exact same prompt multiple times
- Pick the best match from 4 variations
- Use the best result as a reference: "in the style of [previous generation]"

### Sizing & Integration
- Download at highest resolution available
- Scale down in game engine as needed
- Maintain aspect ratios
- Test readability at actual game scale

- Can upgrade to 8-direction later if needed
- Diagonal movements use the closest cardinal direction sprite

### Strategy 2: Full 8-Direction (Higher Quality)
- Smoother character rotation
- More professional look
- 2x the generation work
- Best for final polished version

**Recommendation:** Start with 4-direction, test gameplay, upgrade to 8-direction during polish phase if desired.
