### Player Character: Gisela - 2x2 Directional Sprite Sheet with Animation

**This bundled prompt generates 4 directions with 2-frame walk animation (8 frames total) in a single sprite sheet.**

**ChatGPT Optimized (3x3 Grid with Idle Animation):**
```
Create a video game player character sprite sheet showing 4 directional views with idle and walk animations arranged in a 3x3 grid. This is for a top-down shooter game. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like character sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

PLAYER CHARACTER: Gisela - bright red cartoon crab gunslinger. Hero character. Brown leather cowboy hat on top of shell, red bandana around neck, worn leather holsters. Two silver revolvers - one in each large claw. Natural crab anatomy - prominent claws holding guns, hard red shell with texture and segments, multiple legs visible, eye stalks. Cartoonish proportions, bold and heroic.

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines around every shape. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. Clean, vibrant colors - bright red for shell, brown for hat, silver for guns. No gradients, flat color zones with clear shadows.

ANIMATION: Each direction has idle + 2 walk frames. Idle is neutral standing. Walk frames show subtle leg movement and shell bobbing for simple animation loop.

FRAME LAYOUT - 3x3 Grid:

ROW 1: FACING DOWN/TOWARD CAMERA (3 frames)
- FRAME 1: Idle standing pose, revolvers aimed forward, neutral leg stance
- FRAME 2: Walk step 1 - left legs forward, body shifted slightly left
- FRAME 3: Walk step 2 - right legs forward, body shifted slightly right

ROW 2: FACING LEFT (3 frames)
- FRAME 1: Idle standing pose in left profile, revolvers aimed left, neutral stance
- FRAME 2: Walk step 1 - legs in walking motion leftward, slight lean
- FRAME 3: Walk step 2 - opposite leg positions, body shifted

ROW 3: FACING RIGHT (3 frames)
- FRAME 1: Idle standing pose in right profile, revolvers aimed right, neutral stance
- FRAME 2: Walk step 1 - legs in walking motion rightward, slight lean
- FRAME 3: Walk step 2 - opposite leg positions (mirror of left walk)

OPTIONAL: Can include back view as 4th direction instead of right, or generate separately.

COMPOSITION: Character centered in each frame taking 70% of space. White or transparent background. Clear borders between all 9 frames. Consistent size and detail across all frames. Wild west cowboy meets ocean creature aesthetic.
```

**ChatGPT Optimized (4x2 Grid, 2 Frames Per Direction):**
```
Create a video game player character sprite sheet showing 4 directional views with 2-frame walk animations arranged in a 4x2 grid (4 rows, 2 columns). This is for a top-down shooter game. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like character sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

PLAYER CHARACTER: Gisela - bright red cartoon crab gunslinger. Hero character. Brown leather cowboy hat on top of shell, red bandana around neck, worn leather holsters. Two silver revolvers - one in each large claw. Natural crab anatomy - prominent claws holding guns, hard red shell with texture and segments, multiple legs visible, eye stalks. Cartoonish proportions, bold and heroic.

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines around every shape. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. Clean, vibrant colors - bright red for shell, brown for hat, silver for guns. No gradients, flat color zones with clear shadows.

ANIMATION: Each direction has 2 frames showing a simple walk cycle. Frame 1 is the neutral standing pose. Frame 2 shows a subtle walking motion - legs slightly repositioned, body slightly shifted, shell bobbing slightly. Animation should be subtle but noticeable. This creates a simple idle/walk cycle.

CRITICAL: Each ROW shows a different direction. Each COLUMN shows a different animation frame (Frame 1 = standing, Frame 2 = walking step).

FRAME LAYOUT - 4x2 Grid (4 rows, 2 columns):

ROW 1: FACING DOWN/TOWARD CAMERA
- COLUMN 1 (Frame 1): Gisela faces toward viewer, neutral standing pose, both claws holding revolvers aimed forward, legs in neutral stance
- COLUMN 2 (Frame 2): Same direction, slight walking motion - left legs forward, right legs back, body shifted slightly, shell bobbed down a bit

ROW 2: FACING UP/AWAY FROM CAMERA
- COLUMN 1 (Frame 1): Gisela faces away, back of hat and shell visible, revolvers at sides, neutral standing
- COLUMN 2 (Frame 2): Same direction, walking motion - opposite leg positioning, body shifted, slight shell movement

ROW 3: FACING LEFT
- COLUMN 1 (Frame 1): Gisela in left profile, claws with revolvers aimed left, side view of shell, neutral stance
- COLUMN 2 (Frame 2): Same direction, walking left - legs in walking motion, body leaning slightly into movement, subtle shift

ROW 4: FACING RIGHT
- COLUMN 1 (Frame 1): Gisela in right profile, claws with revolvers aimed right, side view of shell, neutral stance
- COLUMN 2 (Frame 2): Same direction, walking right - legs in walking motion (mirror of left), body leaning right, subtle shift

IMPORTANT: Frame 1 and Frame 2 in each row must be nearly identical except for the subtle walk animation differences. The character's direction, pose, and gun positions stay consistent - only leg positions and body tilt change slightly. This creates a simple 2-frame walk loop.

COMPOSITION: Character centered in each frame taking 70% of space. White or transparent background. Clear borders between all 8 frames. Consistent size and detail across all frames. Wild west cowboy meets ocean creature aesthetic.
```

### Boss Enemies (3 bosses - Multi-Directional)

#### 1. Iron Shell (Wave 3 Boss - Multi-Directional)

**ChatGPT Sprite Sheet - 4 Directions in One Image:**
```
Create a video game boss CHARACTER TURNAROUND sprite sheet showing 4 directional views arranged in a 2x2 grid. This is for a top-down shooter game, so each direction must be CLEARLY DISTINCT for gameplay. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like boss sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

BOSS CHARACTER: Iron Shell - Wave 3 boss. A massive dark gray armored hermit crab. 3x the size of regular enemies. Fortress-like tank unit with heavy metal plating.

ARMOR & FEATURES: Enormous spiral shell covered in iron armor plating with rivets and bolts. Thick armored claws like iron gauntlets. Multiple sturdy legs. Eye stalks with menacing red eyes. Battle-worn metal with scratches. Dark gray and black metal with brown shell visible underneath. Hermit crab anatomy at massive intimidating scale.

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. No gradients. Wild west meets heavy armor aesthetic.

CRITICAL: Each frame must show a DIFFERENT DIRECTION as if rotating a camera around the character in 90-degree increments. Think of it as North, South, East, West views.

FRAME LAYOUT - 2x2 Grid with clear separation:

TOP-LEFT FRAME: "FRONT VIEW - FACING DOWN/TOWARD CAMERA"
- Character faces directly toward the viewer
- Front of face visible with eye stalks pointing forward
- Both armored claws prominently displayed in front, held in threatening forward pose
- Front of armored shell visible from front angle
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves DOWN on screen toward them

TOP-RIGHT FRAME: "BACK VIEW - FACING UP/AWAY FROM CAMERA"
- Character faces directly away from the viewer
- BACK of the massive spiral shell dominates - this is the key identifying feature
- Eye stalks barely visible or not visible (viewing from behind)
- Claws visible at the sides pointing away
- Legs visible from behind
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves UP on screen away from them

BOTTOM-LEFT FRAME: "LEFT SIDE VIEW - FACING LEFT"
- Character in complete LEFT PROFILE moving toward the left side
- Shell visible from side angle showing its curved spiral depth
- BOTH claws extended forward toward the LEFT direction
- Legs in walking stance moving left
- Side profile of head/eye stalks visible on left
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves LEFT on screen

BOTTOM-RIGHT FRAME: "RIGHT SIDE VIEW - FACING RIGHT"

- BOTH claws extended forward toward the RIGHT direction
- Legs in walking stance moving right
- Side profile of head/eye stalks visible on right
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves RIGHT on screen

IMPORTANT: These are CHARACTER ROTATION views, not camera angle changes. The isometric 45-degree viewing angle stays the same - the CHARACTER rotates to face different directions. Front view and back view should look VERY different (front shows face/claws forward, back shows shell back). Left and right profiles should be clear mirror images.

COMPOSITION: Each frame equal size, boss centered taking up 85% of frame space. White/transparent background. Clear borders between frames. All four views must maintain consistent size and detail level.
```

**Alternative: Single Direction Prompts (if sprite sheet doesn't work)**

If you need to generate each direction separately, use the base prompt below and add the direction modifier:

**Base Prompt:** Create a single video game BOSS sprite for a top-down shooter. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above. Iron Shell - massive dark gray armored hermit crab boss, 3x regular size, fortress-like.

#### 2. The Kraken's Arm (Wave 6 Boss - Multi-Directional with Tentacles)

**ChatGPT Sprite Sheet - 4 Directions in One Image:**
```
Create a video game boss CHARACTER TURNAROUND sprite sheet showing 4 directional views arranged in a 2x2 grid. This is for a top-down shooter game, so each direction must be CLEARLY DISTINCT for gameplay. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like boss sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

BOSS CHARACTER: The Kraken's Arm - Wave 6 boss. A massive purple kraken with large bulbous central body and four thick powerful tentacles. Deep-sea horror pirate boss.

OUTFIT & FEATURES: Tattered weathered pirate hat sitting on top of bulbous body, torn and aged. Large purple bulbous head/body as center mass with four thick powerful tentacles extending outward (all 4 must be visible in each frame).

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. Deep purple body, darker blue shadows, glowing spots. Mystical supernatural appearance. No gradients.

CRITICAL: Each frame must show a DIFFERENT DIRECTION as if rotating a camera around the character in 90-degree increments. The central body rotates while all 4 tentacles remain visible spreading outward.

FRAME LAYOUT - 2x2 Grid with clear separation:

TOP-LEFT FRAME: "FRONT VIEW - FACING DOWN/TOWARD CAMERA"
- Central bulbous body faces directly toward the viewer
- Glowing eyes visible on front of body, staring forward
- Tattered pirate hat visible from front angle on top of body
- All four tentacles spread outward around the body, extending toward viewer and sides
- Sucker marks visible on tentacle undersides
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves DOWN on screen toward them

TOP-RIGHT FRAME: "BACK VIEW - FACING UP/AWAY FROM CAMERA"

- This is what the player sees when the boss moves LEFT on screen

BOTTOM-RIGHT FRAME: "RIGHT SIDE VIEW - FACING RIGHT"
- Central body in RIGHT PROFILE orientation (mirror of left view)
- Side view of bulbous body and head from right angle
- Pirate hat visible from right side angle
- One glowing eye visible in side profile
- All four tentacles visible - two extending forward toward right, two toward back/sides
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves RIGHT on screen

IMPORTANT: These are CHARACTER ROTATION views, not camera angle changes. The isometric 45-degree viewing angle stays the same - the CHARACTER rotates to face different directions. All four tentacles must be visible in every frame. Front and back views should look very different (front shows eyes, back shows rear of body).

COMPOSITION: Each frame equal size, boss with tentacles centered taking up 90% of frame space. White/transparent background. Clear borders between frames. All four views must maintain consistent size and detail level.
```

**Alternative: Single Direction Prompts (if sprite sheet doesn't work)**

If you need to generate each direction separately, use the base prompt below and add the direction modifier:

**Base Prompt:** Create a single video game BOSS sprite for a top-down shooter. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above. The Kraken's Arm - massive purple kraken with large bulbous body, tattered pirate hat, four thick writhing tentacles with sucker marks, glowing eyes, bioluminescent spots. Deep-sea horror pirate. Bold comic book art with thick black outlines, cel-shaded, deep purple with darker shadows. Boss centered with all 4 tentacles visible taking 90% of frame, transparent background.

**Direction modifiers:** `, facing toward camera with eyes forward and tentacles spread` | `, facing away showing back of body with tentacles spread` | `, left profile with tentacles spreading left` | `, right profile with tentacles spreading right`

**Behavior notes:** Body is invulnerable until all 4 tentacles are destroyed. Tentacles regenerate over time. Creates ink clouds that slow players.

#### 2b. Kraken Tentacle/Arm (Separate Destructible Parts)

**ChatGPT Sprite Sheet - 4 Variations in One Image:**
```
Create a video game boss component sprite sheet showing 4 tentacle variations arranged in a 2x2 grid. This is for a top-down shooter game. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

BOSS COMPONENT: Kraken tentacles/arms - destructible boss parts for The Kraken's Arm boss fight. These are the four tentacles that protect the main boss body and must be destroyed independently.

FEATURES: Large thick purple tentacles with muscular appearance. Covered in circular sucker marks along underside. Textured oceanic skin with deep purple coloring and darker blue-purple shadows. Bioluminescent spots glowing faintly scattered along length. Base end (where it connects to body) is thicker, tapering toward the tip. Battle-scarred with possible notches or scars showing they've been in combat.

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. Deep purple with darker shadows, subtle glowing spots. Mystical deep-sea creature aesthetic. No gradients. Must match the main Kraken boss visual style.

CRITICAL: Each tentacle should have a DIFFERENT POSE/CURVE for visual variety, but maintain the same design, color, and style. This creates natural variation when all 4 are positioned around the boss.

FRAME LAYOUT - 2x2 Grid with clear separation:

TOP-LEFT FRAME: "TENTACLE 1 - CURVED LEFT"
- Tentacle curves in a strong leftward arc
- Sucker marks visible on underside as it curves
- Bioluminescent spots glowing along the length
- Writhing, independently alive appearance
- Base at bottom-right, tip extending toward top-left

TOP-RIGHT FRAME: "TENTACLE 2 - CURVED RIGHT"
- Tentacle curves in a strong rightward arc (mirror of Tentacle 1)
- Sucker marks visible on underside as it curves
- Bioluminescent spots glowing along the length
- Writhing, independently alive appearance
- Base at bottom-left, tip extending toward top-right

BOTTOM-LEFT FRAME: "TENTACLE 3 - COILED/S-CURVE"
- Tentacle forms an S-shaped coil showing dynamic movement
- More complex curve creating visual interest
- Sucker marks visible throughout the curves
- Bioluminescent spots emphasizing the coiled shape
- Base at bottom, tip curling back creating the S-shape

BOTTOM-RIGHT FRAME: "TENTACLE 4 - REACHING FORWARD"
- Tentacle extends more directly forward/upward
- Less curved, more aggressive reaching pose
- Sucker marks along length as it stretches
- Bioluminescent spots running along the extended length
- Base at bottom, tip reaching toward top with slight curve

IMPORTANT: All four tentacles are the SAME tentacle type with identical coloring, texture, sucker marks, and bioluminescent spots. Only the POSE/CURVE differs. They should all look like they belong to the same creature. Each should feel substantial - these are mini-boss components.

COMPOSITION: Each frame equal size, single tentacle centered taking up 70% of frame space. White/transparent background. Clear borders between frames. All four must be the same size and detail level, matching the Kraken boss aesthetic.
```

**Alternative: Single Tentacle Prompt (if sprite sheet doesn't work)**

If you need to generate variations separately, use this base prompt:

**Base Prompt:** Create a single video game boss component sprite for a top-down shooter. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above. Single Kraken tentacle - large thick purple tentacle with muscular appearance, circular sucker marks on underside, textured oceanic skin, bioluminescent spots glowing faintly. Battle-scarred with notches. Base end thick tapering to tip. Bold comic book art with thick black outlines, cel-shaded, deep purple with darker shadows. Tentacle centered taking 70% of frame, transparent background. Deep-sea horror aesthetic matching main Kraken boss.

**Pose variations to request separately:**
- `, curved in a strong leftward arc`
- `, curved in a strong rightward arc`
- `, forming an S-shaped coil`
- `, reaching forward with slight curve`

**Bing Condensed (480 chars):**
```
Isometric 3/4 view single large purple kraken tentacle, muscular with sucker marks, curved alive pose, bioluminescent spots, deep-sea creature, destructible boss part, 45° angle above, RimWorld style sprite, comic book art, thick black outlines, cel-shading, mystical oceanic appearance, wild west beach theme, game enemy sprite on transparent background
```

**Usage Notes:**
- Generate 4 tentacles with different poses for visual variety when positioned around the boss
- All 4 should match the main Kraken boss in color and style
- Consider adding "damaged" versions showing cracks/wounds for when tentacle health is low
- Each tentacle is independently targetable and destructible

**Result:** Four tentacle variations that can be positioned around the central Kraken body, allowing players to target and destroy them independently while maintaining visual variety.

- This is what the player sees when the boss moves RIGHT on screen

IMPORTANT: These are CHARACTER ROTATION views, not camera angle changes. The isometric 45-degree viewing angle stays the same - the CHARACTER rotates to face different directions. Front and back views should look very different (front shows fierce face, back shows rear/tail). Left and right profiles should be clear mirror images.

COMPOSITION: Each frame equal size, legendary boss dominates 95% of frame space. White/transparent background. Clear borders between frames. All four views must maintain consistent size, scale detail, and epic presence.

Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above, like epic boss sprites in Stardew Valley or Enter the Gungeon.

FINAL BOSS EVOLVED: The Leviathan Phase 2 - Wave 9 final boss SECOND FORM. Same colossal sea serpent but TRANSFORMED with electrical powers. This is the "ultimate final form" moment. Storm god boss.

TRANSFORMATION & FEATURES: Electric blue coloring replaces orange-red. Crackling lightning and electricity arcing across ENTIRE body. Electrical aura surrounding boss. Glowing electric eyes radiating power. Energy visibly crackling from body with yellow lightning bolts. Same golden cowboy accessories but now GLOWING with electrical energy - hat, badge, and spurs all energized and sparking. Same serpentine anatomy - long powerful coiled body, massive scaled body, fins along spine, dragon-like head. Godlike electrical storm powers unleashed. Enormous - fills 95% of frame. Most powerful form in game.

STYLE: Bold comic book art with thick black ink outlines. Cel-shaded with 2-3 flat tone levels. Bright electric blue scales, yellow lightning effects, glowing golden accessories. Dramatic electrical transformation. Lightning effects integrated into cel-shading style. No gradients.

CRITICAL: Each frame must show a DIFFERENT DIRECTION as if rotating a camera around the character in 90-degree increments. The electrified serpentine body rotates while maintaining its powerful storm god pose.

FRAME LAYOUT - 2x2 Grid with clear separation:

TOP-LEFT FRAME: "FRONT VIEW - FACING DOWN/TOWARD CAMERA"
- Serpent's head faces directly toward the viewer with GLOWING ELECTRIC EYES
- Dragon-like head prominent with electricity crackling around it
- Golden cowboy hat GLOWING with electrical energy from front angle
- Golden sheriff's badge GLOWING and sparking on chest/front
- Electric blue serpentine body coiled behind with VISIBLE LIGHTNING ARCS
- Yellow lightning bolts crackling across body
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves DOWN on screen toward them

TOP-RIGHT FRAME: "BACK VIEW - FACING UP/AWAY FROM CAMERA"
- Serpent faces away from the viewer
- BACK of the electrified head and body dominates
- Back of glowing golden hat visible with electrical aura
- Electric blue serpentine body coiling away, electricity arcing along spine fins
- Golden spurs GLOWING on tail sections with lightning effects
- Eyes barely visible glowing through electrical aura
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves UP on screen away from them

BOTTOM-LEFT FRAME: "LEFT SIDE VIEW - FACING LEFT"
- Serpent in LEFT PROFILE orientation
- Side view of dragon-like head facing left with GLOWING eye radiating electricity
- Glowing golden hat visible from left side with electrical sparks
- Glowing badge visible from side angle sparking with energy
- Electric blue serpentine body coiled showing side profile with lightning arcing along fins
- Yellow lightning bolts visible across body
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves LEFT on screen

BOTTOM-RIGHT FRAME: "RIGHT SIDE VIEW - FACING RIGHT"
- Serpent in RIGHT PROFILE orientation (mirror of left view)
- Side view of dragon-like head facing right with GLOWING eye radiating electricity
- Glowing golden hat visible from right side with electrical sparks
- Glowing badge visible from side angle sparking with energy
- Electric blue serpentine body coiled showing side profile with lightning arcing along fins
- Yellow lightning bolts visible across body
- This is what the player sees when the boss moves RIGHT on screen

IMPORTANT: These are CHARACTER ROTATION views, not camera angle changes. The isometric 45-degree viewing angle stays the same - the CHARACTER rotates to face different directions. Front and back views should look very different. Left and right profiles should be clear mirror images. The electrical effects (lightning, glow, arcs) must be present in ALL four views.

COMPOSITION: Each frame equal size, legendary evolved boss dominates 95% of frame space. White/transparent background. Clear borders between frames. All four views must maintain consistent size, electrical effects, and epic transformed presence.
```

**Alternative: Single Direction Prompts (if sprite sheet doesn't work)**

If you need to generate each direction separately, use these base prompts and add the direction modifier:

**Phase 1 Base Prompt:** Create a single video game FINAL BOSS sprite for a top-down shooter. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above. The Leviathan Phase 1 - colossal orange-red sea serpent, golden cowboy hat, golden sheriff's badge, golden spurs on tail, legendary final boss. Long powerful coiled serpentine body, massive scales, prominent spine fins, dragon-like fierce head, battle-scarred ancient. Bold comic book art with thick black outlines, cel-shaded, bold orange-red scales with golden accessories. Boss dominates 95% of frame, transparent background.

**Phase 2 Base Prompt:** Create a single video game FINAL BOSS EVOLVED FORM sprite for a top-down shooter. Use an isometric 3/4 perspective viewed from 45 degrees above. The Leviathan Phase 2 - same colossal sea serpent but ELECTRIC BLUE with crackling lightning across entire body, electrical aura, glowing electric eyes, yellow lightning bolts. Golden cowboy accessories now GLOWING with electrical energy. Storm god transformation. Bold comic book art with thick black outlines, cel-shaded, bright electric blue with yellow lightning effects. Boss dominates 95% of frame, transparent background.

**Direction modifiers (both phases):** `, facing toward camera with head forward` | `, facing away showing back and tail` | `, left profile view` | `, right profile view`

**Behavior notes:** Phase 1 (orange-red) uses bullet storms, ground pounds, and charges. At 0 HP, transitions to Phase 2 (electric blue) with full health restore, lightning strikes, tidal waves, and spawns minions.

### Start Screen / Title Screen

**ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Optimized (Recommended):**

**Heroic Version:**
```
Create a dramatic video game title screen illustration in comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading. In the foreground, feature a heroic red cartoon crab gunslinger named Gisela - she's wearing a brown cowboy hat, red bandana around her neck, and holding two revolvers in a confident pose. She has natural crab features (claws, shell texture) but anthropomorphic. Behind her in the background, show a weathered wooden beach saloon with sandy elements and driftwood, with "Gisela's Last Stand" written on a sign above the swinging doors. Dark shadowy silhouettes of enemy sea creatures are attacking the saloon - lobster bandits, shrimp gunslingers, and hermit crab tanks emerging from darkness. Use dramatic sunset lighting with orange and purple sky tones creating long shadows. The composition should be cinematic with space at the top for a game logo. Wild west meets ocean beach aesthetic, bold saturated colors, stylized but detailed.
```

**Action Version:**
```
Create an action-packed video game title screen in comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading. Center frame shows a dynamic red cartoon crab gunslinger Gisela in motion - brown cowboy hat, red bandana, dual revolvers firing with bright muzzle flashes. She has natural crab features but stands upright like a cowboy. Behind her, a weathered beach saloon building is under siege, with "Gisela's Last Stand" carved above the doors. Warm golden light spills from the saloon windows. Dark enemy silhouettes surround the scene - menacing shapes of lobsters, shrimp, hermit crabs, and flying fish approaching from all sides creating a sense of danger. Dramatic sunset sky with orange and red tones. The composition is cinematic with room for title logo placement. Wild west beach theme, bold colors, game illustration style similar to Enter the Gungeon or Stardew Valley promotional art.

## Generation Tips

### ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Specific Tips

**For Sprite Generation:**
1. Start prompts with "Create a video game sprite" or "Create a game character asset"
2. Be explicit about the view angle: "isometric 3/4 top-down view at 45-degree angle"
3. Reference similar games for context: "similar to RimWorld, Stardew Valley, or Enter the Gungeon sprites"
4. Specify "transparent background" or "on white background for easy removal"
5. Request "square composition" or "centered in frame" for easier cropping
6. Mention "single character sprite" to avoid multiple variations in one image

**For Scene/Illustration Generation:**
1. Start with "Create a [style] illustration" or "Create a [style] scene"
2. Describe composition: "foreground, midground, background" explicitly
3. Specify lighting: "dramatic sunset lighting", "warm saloon lighting", etc.
4. Mention color palette: "bold saturated colors", "warm orange and purple tones"
5. Add style references: "comic book art style similar to [game/artist]"
6. Request specific aspect ratios if needed: "wide cinematic composition", "portrait orientation"

**Iterating with ChatGPT:**
- If results don't match: Ask ChatGPT to "adjust the previous image by..." rather than starting fresh
- Use "make it more [adjective]" for fine-tuning: "make it more cartoonish", "make it darker"
- Reference previous generations: "using the same style as the previous crab character"
- Request variations: "create 3 similar versions with slight pose differences"

**Common Issues & Fixes:**
- **Too realistic?** Add "stylized cartoon art", "simplified shapes", "comic book style"
- **Wrong angle?** Emphasize "viewed from 45-degree angle above", "slight overhead perspective"
- **Busy background?** Request "simple background", "minimal background", or "transparent background"
- **Inconsistent style?** Always include full style description: "comic book art with thick black outlines and cel-shading"

---

### Consistency Rules
1. **Always include:** "comic book art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading"
2. **Always include:** "wild west beach theme" or "wild west saloon aesthetic"
3. **Always include:** "transparent background" for sprites
4. **Always include:** "isometric 3/4 top-down view" for characters/objects
5. **Reference games:** Mention "RimWorld or Stardew Valley character sprite" for consistency

### If Results Drift
- Regenerate with the exact same prompt multiple times
- Pick the best match from 4 variations
- Use the best result as a reference: "in the style of [previous generation]"

### Sizing & Integration
- Download at highest resolution available
- Scale down in game engine as needed
- Maintain aspect ratios
- Test readability at actual game scale

## Recommended Generation Approach

### Strategy 1: Start with 4-Direction (Recommended)
- Faster to generate (63 sprites vs 120)
- Still looks good in gameplay
- Can upgrade to 8-direction later if needed
- Diagonal movements use the closest cardinal direction sprite

### Strategy 2: Full 8-Direction (Higher Quality)
- Smoother character rotation
- More professional look
- 2x the generation work
- Best for final polished version

**Recommendation:** Start with 4-direction, test gameplay, upgrade to 8-direction during polish phase if desired.

## Next Steps for Full Asset Generation

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay Assets (MVP)
1. ✅ Red crab player (1 direction - done for testing)
2. Generate remaining 3 player colors × 4 directions = 12 sprites
3. Generate 4 remaining enemy types × 4 directions = 16 sprites
4. Generate 6 cocktail powerups = 6 sprites
5. Test in-game with existing background

**Total for Phase 1:** ~34 new sprites

### Phase 2: Enhanced Assets
1. Generate 4 bounty enemy variants × 4 directions = 16 sprites
2. Generate additional environment props (barrels, tables) = 4-5 sprites
3. Generate UI elements = 5-10 sprites
4. Polish and integrate

**Total for Phase 2:** ~30 sprites

### Phase 3: Polish Assets
1. Generate particle effects (muzzle flashes, bullet trails, explosions)
2. Generate additional decoration elements
3. Generate menu/UI graphics
4. Final integration and testing
